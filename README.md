I am a young graduate from the University of Houston with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science currently working for a company as a full-stack software engineer. With programming being a main interest of mine alongside gaming, I find myself naturally drawn to game and app development.

Please reach out to me here for any questions or opportunities, I would be more than happy to learn from you and other experienced people in this field.
