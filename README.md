Hi, I’m Michael. I am a young graduate from the University of Houston with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science currently searching for a career in software development. With programming being a main interest of mine alongside gaming, I find myself naturally drawn to game, web, and API development. I am stronger in back-end development than front-end, but being full-stack competent is a goal of mine.

Please reach out to me here for any questions or opportunities, I would be more than happy to learn from you and other experienced people in this field.
